# 🏗️ InfraStaking: The Compliance-Ready Aggregator for DePIN and Liquid Staking

🚀 **InfraStaking** is the **onchain compliance layer** for DePIN InfraStaking. We make **Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs)** safe, private, and easy to access for **institutions and businesses**, while automating liquid staking and restaking to **maximize rewards**.

## 🌍 Problem

DePIN protocols are the future of decentralized infrastructure—powering compute, bandwidth, storage, and more. But for **institutions** and **enterprises**, the landscape is:

- ❌ **Fragmented** – Multiple protocols, each with unique interfaces and onboarding processes.
- ❌ **Opaque** – No clear compliance or privacy guarantees for sensitive data and resources.
- ❌ **Risky** – Institutions won’t run unknown scripts or lock assets without proof of security.
- ❌ **Inefficient** – Billions in idle compute, GPU, and bandwidth are wasted.

## 💡 Solution: InfraStaking

InfraStaking is a **DePIN aggregator and compliance layer** that:

✅ **Onboards institutions into DePINs** via a single, secure, and compliant gateway.
✅ **Ensures privacy** and **compliance** with **eERC** (Encrypted ERC) and **Avacy** on Avalanche.
✅ **Automates liquid staking and restaking** to **maximize yield** using protocols like **Benqi** and **Suzaku**.
✅ **Compounds rewards** from DePIN nodes into **liquid, tradable assets** across ecosystems.

## 🔒 How InfraStaking Works

### 1️⃣ DePIN Aggregation

- We connect institutional users to DePIN protocols like **Flux**.
- Deploy nodes using institution-owned resources (GPU, CPU, bandwidth) with **full privacy** and **compliance guarantees**.
- Earn rewards in **Flux tokens**.

### 2️⃣ Liquid Staking & Restaking Flow

- Swap Flux tokens to **AVAX** via **Zelcore** and **Uniswap**.
- Stake AVAX in **Benqi** to get **sAVAX (Liquid Staking Token)**.
- Restake sAVAX in **Suzaku** to earn **LRTs (Liquid Restaking Tokens)** and additional rewards.
- Compound and manage rewards automatically.

### 3️⃣ Privacy & Compliance Layer

- Use **eERC** for **confidential transactions** and **auditability**.
- **Avacy** provides **zero-knowledge identity proofs** for KYC/AML compliance.
- Institutions control what data is shared, when, and to whom—**no blind trust required**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer            | Technology               | Purpose                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Compliance Layer | eERC + Avacy (Avalanche) | Privacy-preserving compliance for DePIN |
| DePIN Protocols  | Flux                     | Node deployment & resource rewards      |
| Liquid Staking   | Benqi (sAVAX)            | Stake AVAX & get liquid rewards         |
| Restaking        | Suzaku (LRTs)            | Restake for compounding & LRT rewards   |
| Wallets          | Zelcore                  | Cross-chain asset management            |

## 📊 Why It Matters

✅ **Institutions Can Now Trust DePINs** – Privacy, compliance, and transparency at every step.

✅ **Maximum Yield** – Earn rewards on idle infrastructure _and_ stake them across ecosystems.

✅ **Seamless UX** – One-click onboarding, no messy scripts, no manual setup.

✅ **Future-Proof** – Scalable architecture for multi-chain support.

## 🔍 Project Scope

This is our **hackathon prototype**. Here's what we've built:

✅ DePIN Aggregation Engine (Flux + eERC + Avacy integration)

✅ Liquid Staking Workflow (Flux → AVAX → sAVAX)

✅ Restaking Workflow (sAVAX → Suzaku)

✅ Compliance Layer with **selective data sharing**

✅ Automated Reward Handling Flow (Flux rewards → liquid assets)
